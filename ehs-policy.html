This is in line with our purpose to transform the lives of the farmers we serve through reduction of losses, maintaining the quality of their produce and providing innovative solutions that incorporate IoT.

        <p>Post harvest loss is one of the greatest challenges our agricultural sector faces accounting for 20%-30% losses in harvested produce. This is brought about by various factors such as poor storage facilities, inadequate handling techniques, lack of proper transportation among others. SCT noticed the market gap and stepped in with our innovative solutions that has brought positive impact to the farmers in terms of income and reduction in post-harvest losses.</p>
        <p>Our long-term plan has been to have all levels of farmers have access to our products by making it affordable across all levels of farmers, from the small scale to the large-scale farmers. In relation to this, we introduced the Nomad cans that are affordable and cuts across all levels of farmers.</p>

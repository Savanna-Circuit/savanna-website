        <h1>Anti-Harassment Policy</h1>
        <p>This policy describes how Savanna Circuit Technologies aims to protect our employees, contractors, customers, and any other stakeholders from harassment, including sexual harassment.</p>
        <p>This policy applies to all employees of Savanna Circuit Technologies, whether permanent, temporary, part-time, or contract-based, as well as interns, volunteers, clients, vendors, and partners engaged with the company.</p>

        <h2>1.1. Definitions</h2>
        <p>Harassment includes bullying, intimidation, direct insults, malicious gossip and victimisation. This is not an exhaustive list, but here are some instances that we consider harassment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sabotaging someone’s work on purpose</li>
            <li>Engaging in frequent or unwanted advances of any nature</li>
            <li>Commenting derogatorily on a person’s ethnic heritage or religious belief</li>
            <li>Starting or spreading rumours about a person’s personal life</li>
            <li>Ridiculing someone in front of others or singling them out to perform tasks unrelated to their job (e.g., bringing coffee) against their will</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Furthermore, any employee who makes a bad faith complaint of inappropriate behaviour (discrimination or (sexual) harassment) towards another employee is considered to be undertaking harassment. A bad faith complaint is one where the complainant knowingly lies or misrepresents the situation to accuse a co-worker, damage someone’s reputation, or gain personal gain.</p>
        
        <h3>Sexual Harassment</h3>
        <p>Sexual harassment has many forms. A person sexually harasses someone when they:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Insinuate, propose or demand sexual favours of any kind</li>
            <li>Invade another person’s personal space (e.g., inappropriate touching)</li>
            <li>Stalk, intimidate, coerce or threaten another person to get them to engage in sexual acts</li>
            <li>Send or display sexually explicit objects or messages</li>
            <li>Comment on someone’s looks, dress, sexuality or gender in a derogatory or objectifying manner or a manner that makes them uncomfortable</li>
            <li>Make obscene comments, jokes or gestures that humiliate or offend someone</li>
            <li>Pursue or flirt with another person persistently without the other person’s willing participation. Also, flirting with someone at an inappropriate time (e.g., in a team meeting) is considered sexual harassment, even when these advances would have been welcome in a different setting. This is because such actions can harm a person’s professional reputation and expose them to further harassment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The most extreme form of sexual harassment is sexual assault. This is a serious crime and our company will support employees who decide to press charges against perpetrators.</p>

        <h3>Our principles concerning sexual harassment and assault</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No one has the right to sexually harass our employees. Also, if representatives of our contractors or vendors sexually harass our employees, we will ask that the company they work for take disciplinary action and/or refuse to work with this person in the future.</li>
            <li>Sexual harassment is never too minor to be dealt with. Any kind of harassment can create a hostile workplace. We will hear every claim and punish perpetrators appropriately.</li>
            <li>Sexual harassment is about how we make others feel. Many do not consider behaviours like flirting or sexual comments to be sexual harassment, thinking they are too innocent to be labelled that way. But if something you do makes your colleagues uncomfortable or makes them feel unsafe, you must stop.</li>
            <li>We take every report of sexual harassment seriously and treat all claims with the care and respect. We handle all parties involved fairly and without bias.. We listen to victims of sexual harassment and always conduct our investigations properly. Occasional fake reports do not undermine this principle.</li>
            <li>We will not allow further victimisation of harassed employees. We will fully support employees who were sexually harassed and will not take any adverse action against them. For example, we will not move them to positions with worse pay or benefits or allow others to retaliate against them.</li>
            <li>All employees share a responsibility to prevent and address sexual harassment. Managers and senior management especially, are obliged to prevent sexual harassment and act when they have suspicions or receive reports. Letting this behaviour persist or encouraging it will bring about disciplinary action. Anyone who witnesses an incident of sexual harassment or has other kinds of proof should report to management. All reports will be handled confidentially, and without retaliation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anyone can be a victim of sexual harassment, regardless of their gender and of the gender of the harasser. What matters is that the sexual conduct is unwanted and unwelcome by the person against whom the conduct is directed.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, people who harass others do not realise that their behaviour is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn’t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.</p>

        <h2>1.2. Grievance mechanisms for harassment</h2>
        <p>If you are being harassed, whether by a colleague, customer or vendor, you can choose to speak with any of the following individuals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Perpetrator:</strong> If you suspect that a perpetrator doesn’t realise they have committed harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g., inappropriate jokes between colleagues). Avoid using this approach with customers or stakeholders.</li>
            <li><strong>Your manager:</strong> If customers, stakeholders or team members are involved in your claim, you may reach out to your manager. Your manager will assess your situation and may contact senior management if appropriate.</li>
            <li><strong>Senior Management:</strong> Feel free to reach out to the senior management in any case of harassment, no matter how minor it may seem. For your safety, contact <a href="mailto:speakup@sav-circuit.com">speakup@sav-circuit.com</a> as soon as possible in cases of serious harassment or if your manager is involved in your claim. Anything you disclose will remain strictly confidential.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You also have the option of filing an anonymous complaint via the form below to senior management. Please be as specific as possible with regards to the allegation, to allow this complaint to be properly investigated.</p>

        <h2>1.3. Grievance mechanisms for sexual harassment</h2>
        <p>We acknowledge it’s often hard to come forward about these issues, but we need your help to build a fair and safe workplace for you and your colleagues.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to report any incident and put any incidents into writing to assist in any follow-up investigations.</p>
        <p>However, in serious cases (i.e., if you are a victim of or witness to sexual assault), and you want to report to the police, our company will provide any possible support until the matter is resolved. In any case, we will ensure that you are not victimised and that you have access to relevant evidence admissible in court, like security video footage or emails (without revealing confidential information about other employees).</p>

        <h2>1.4. Investigations of harassment and sexual harassment allegations</h2>
        <p>Once the complaint has been received, the management must carry out the required investigations and follow-up. The process will be carried out according to the following guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a complaint file, for which the confidentiality and privacy are safeguarded, with a detailed record of the facts.</li>
            <li>Individually interview the people involved.</li>
            <li>Issuing a report to the senior management with all the information collected during the investigation, the findings, and the concluded recommendations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is the responsibility of the management to ensure the procedure has been duly followed, and there is a secure record of all actions taken.</p>
        <p>Should it be considered impractical or impossible to maintain confidentiality within this process, due to the individuals involved or the size of our team, we will employ the services of an external, independent party to conduct the investigation. This ensures fairness, impartiality, and protection for all parties concerned. Our priority is to create a safe and respectful workplace where all individuals can raise concerns without fear of retaliation or exposure.</p>

        <h3>Disciplinary consequences</h3>
        <p>Punishment for any instance of discrimination, harassment or sexual harassment will follow a thorough process of investigation. While reports of any inappropriate behaviour will be taken seriously and treated in good faith, any employee accused of inappropriate behaviour will nevertheless be treated with respect. Depending on the severity and credibility of the accusation, the accused employee may be suspended with or without pay for the duration of the investigation.</p>
        <p>The nature of the sanctions will depend on the severity and scope of the discrimination or harassment. We will use the following guidelines for minimum sanctions, and maintain discretion to use harsher sanctions where deemed necessary by the management.</p>
        <p>For verbal or non-verbal discrimination and/or harassment of a mild nature, meaning any verbal or non-verbal behaviour that makes others feel uncomfortable or unvalued based on their protected characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Isolated incidents:</strong> Verbal and written calls for attention by management.</li>
            <li><strong>Recurring behaviour by an individual:</strong> Formal warning and requirement of relevant (sensitivity) training.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For verbal or non-verbal discrimination and/or harassment of a moderate nature, meaning persistent discrimination, bullying, overt favouritism based on protected characteristics, or unwanted physical contact:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Isolated incidents:</strong> Formal warning, possible fine, and requirement of relevant (sensitivity) training.</li>
            <li><strong>Recurring behaviour by an individual:</strong> Formal warning, possible fine, possibility of seeing promotions and/or salary increases freeze for a period of time, with possible suspension and termination.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For verbal or non-verbal discrimination and/or harassment of a serious nature, including any and all sexual assault, meaning any aggressive behaviour, unwanted sexual contact, and deliberately withholding opportunities from people based on protected characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Isolated incidents:</strong> Formal warning, requirement of relevant (sensitivity) training and suspension.</li>
            <li><strong>Recurring behaviour by an individual:</strong> Termination.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may also transfer harassers or take other appropriate action to protect their victims, in consultation with the victims and in adherence to their wishes.</p>
        <p>We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalised the same way for the same offences.</p>

        <h3>Malicious Complaints</h3>
        <p>While protection is provided under this policy, deliberate, false or malicious allegations will not be tolerated. Anyone found making deliberate, false or malicious allegations will be subjected to disciplinary action. In addition, any costs that arise due to investigations done on the basis of deliberately false allegations will be claimed as damages suffered by the Company from the employee who made the false and malicious allegations. However, malicious intent can be determined only after an inquiry. Inability to substantiate a complaint does not make it malicious.</p>

        <h3>Non-retaliation stipulation</h3>
        <p>Savanna Circuit Technologies prohibits retaliation against any person who files a complaint against discrimination or (sexual) harassment.</p>
        <p>We encourage employees to come forward and participate in investigations, and we will make all reasonable efforts to keep investigations confidential and to protect people who make complaints.</p>
        <p>Whether accusations are true or false, our company wants to prevent victimisation and other retaliatory behaviour towards the employee, as we want to ensure an environment in which employees are comfortable speaking up about any issues.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that this stipulation refers to circumstances in which an employee’s report is true as well as circumstances where the report is baseless. We don’t consider the report’s validity when it comes to the no-retaliation principle.</p>
        <p>Retaliation in general is defined as any kind of negative action against a current or former employee that takes the form of punishment, and creates a hostile, threatening or uncomfortable environment as a result of their reported complaint.</p>
        <p>Retaliation in the workplace may be expressed in a variety of ways. These include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Victimisation</li>
            <li>Termination or illegal retraction of benefits</li>
            <li>Reduction of compensation</li>
            <li>Poor work performance evaluation</li>
            <li>Exclusion from company events or meetings</li>
            <li>Defamation of character (prominent in cases of former employees)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If an employee retaliates against another employee for reporting harassment or discrimination, that employee will face serious consequences up to and including termination. Disciplinary action may also apply to employees who have repeatedly filed false or unreasonable (‘bad faith’) complaints against us or other employees, and are proven to have been intentionally lying, falsifying evidence, acting maliciously or for personal benefit. That way, we can ensure that employees do not take advantage of our policies and always act in good faith.</p>

        <h3>Support for Victims</h3>
        <p>Any employee who reports harassment will be provided with appropriate support, which may include counselling services, adjustments to working arrangements, or referral to external resources. Such support will be tailored to the individual’s needs and offered without prejudice.</p>
        
        <h3>Policy Review</h3>
        <p>This policy will be reviewed annually, or sooner if required by changes in legislation, workplace incidents, or feedback from employees, to ensure it remains relevant and effective.</p>

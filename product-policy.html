            <li><strong>Client Responsibilities:</strong> The client is responsible for providing necessary utilities (stabilized power, soft water, drainage, gas lines) within 1.0M of the equipment location.</li>
            <li><strong>Completion:</strong> Installation is deemed complete once the equipment is commissioned and put into use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Maintenance and After-Sales Support</h2>
        <p>We are dedicated to the longevity of your equipment:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC):</strong> After the free service period, we strongly recommend signing an AMC to ensure continuous operation and revenue generation.</li>
            <li><strong>Spare Parts:</strong> We maintain a stock of essential spare parts. We suggest clients invest 5% of the contract value in spare parts inventory for immediate availability.</li>
            <li><strong>Training:</strong> We offer training for your technicians at our Nairobi workshop to handle minor repairs and maintenance.</li>
